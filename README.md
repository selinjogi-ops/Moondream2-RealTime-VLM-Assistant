## 🏗️ System Architecture

Moondream-2 integrates:

* **Vision Encoder** → Converts image into visual embeddings
* **Language Model** → Generates contextual text responses

Core workflow:

1. Capture frame via OpenCV
2. Encode image using `encode_image()`
3. Generate response using `answer_question()`
4. Translate (optional)
5. Convert text → speech
6. Play audio output
